# Forecasting India's Economic Future: A Linear Regression Approach
This project utilizes historical GDP data of India from 1960 to 2023 to predict future GDP values for 2024 and 2025. Using a linear regression model, it provides insights into the economic trajectory of one of the world's fastest-growing economies. 

At the heart of this project is the [`Forecasting_India_GDP.ipynb`](https://github.com/neuraledgeai/India_GDP_Forecasting_Project/blob/main/Forecasting_India_GDP.ipynb) notebook. This file contains the full analysis, from data preparation and feature engineering to model building and evaluation.



## Purpose
This project is designed for **educational purposes** and to demonstrate the **capabilities** of time series analysis using linear regression. Through this project, you’ll gain an intuitive understanding of how to approach time series forecasting in a practical and reasonable way. It encompasses various aspects of data science, such as:

- **Data preparation**
- **Model building**
- **Model evaluation**
- Showcasing special **data scientist skills** like dealing with real-world datasets, handling outliers, and visualizing results.

This project is proudly dedicated to the **open-source community**, with the goal of helping learners and professionals explore the practical applications of machine learning.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic GDP Predictions**: Forecasts GDP values for the upcoming years.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built using Streamlit, providing an engaging user interface.
- **Visualizations**: Clear and informative plots showcasing GDP trends over time and actual vs. predicted values.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for building the regression model.
- **Plotly & Matplotlib**: Libraries for creating interactive visualizations.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building web applications for data science.
